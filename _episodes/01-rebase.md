  - What is the advantage of merging?
  - What is the advantage of rebasing?
objectives:
  - Obtain a mental representation of the rebase model.
keypoints:
  - Rebasing creates nice linear history without merge commits, 
    but is associated with potential risks.

## Rebase vs. merge

To illustrate rebasing we consider the following situation - we wish to merge
`master` into `devel`:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/pre-rebase.svg)

Now you know how to do it:

```shell
$ git checkout devel
$ git merge master
```

This creates a merge commit:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/git-branch-08.svg)


But there is an alternative for integrating `master` commits into the `devel`
branch:

```shell
$ git checkout devel
$ git rebase master
```

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/rebase.svg)

- `git rebase` replays the branch commits `b1` to `b3` on top of `master`.
- As if they were committed after `c5`.
- This **changes history** (notice that the commits `b1` to `b3` have been replaced by `b1*` to `b3*`).
- Discuss the advantages and disadvantages.

### Advantages and disadvantages

- `git rebase` makes "merges" producing a linear history.
- `git merge` resolves all conflicts in a single commit, with `git rebase` each commit may need
  conflict resolution.
- `git rebase` may invalidate tests.
- `git merge` preserves chronology of commits and creates explicit merge commits (unless fast-forward).
- `git rebase` can change chronology of commits.
- When working with others **do not rebase commits that other people depend on**
  (history has changed).
- Reference: "Treehouse of Horror V: Time and Punishment", The Simpsons (1994).

## Question

- How does rebasing affect testing?
